                Prior to the event, Kitt prepared diligently, researching and rehearsing her speech. She was determined
                to use this platform to voice her concerns about the Vietnam War and racial inequality. Despite knowing
                the potential backlash, Kitt remained resolute in her commitment to speaking truth to power.
